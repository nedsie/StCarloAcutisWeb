  <h3>Life of St. Carlo Acutis - <i>"The First Millennial Saint"</i></h3>
  <p>Carlo Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London, but was raised in Milan, Italy. From a young age, he showed a deep love for God, particularly for the Eucharist, which he called his “highway to heaven.” He attended daily Mass, prayed the Rosary, and spent time in Eucharistic adoration.</p>
  <p>Aside from his faith, Carlo was an ordinary teenager who enjoyed video games, soccer, and spending time with friends. However, he stood out because of his kindness, his concern for others, and his ability to see God in everyday life. He also had a passion for technology, which he used to serve the Church.</p>
  <p>Sadly, Carlo was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of 15. He offered his suffering for the Pope and the Church, saying, “I am happy to die because I lived my life without wasting a minute on things that do not please God.” He died on October 12, 2006, and was buried in Assisi, Italy.</p>

  <h3>Miracles</h3>
  <p>Carlo Acutis is credited with miracles that have been recognized or reported through his intercession. The most important and well-documented case is the Miracle in Brazil (2013), when a seven-year-old boy suffering from a rare congenital pancreatic disease known as annular pancreas was miraculously healed. After the child and his family prayed for Carlo’s intercession, the boy’s pancreas was completely restored, with doctors confirming the cure as medically inexplicable. This healing was officially attributed to Carlo and became the key miracle that led to his beatification in 2020.</p>
  <p>In addition to this recognized miracle, countless testimonies from around the world speak of other extraordinary favors, including physical healings and, most significantly, Spiritual Conversions. Many people who have prayed through Carlo’s intercession have reported renewed faith, deeper devotion to the Eucharist, and profound changes in their lives. While only one miracle has been officially confirmed by the Church so far, ongoing accounts of healings and transformations continue to strengthen Carlo’s reputation as a powerful intercessor for the faithful.</p>

  <h3>Advancement in Technology</h3>
  <p>Carlo Acutis is often called the <strong>“Patron of the Internet”</strong> because of the way he used technology for faith and evangelization. Even at a young age, he showed remarkable skill in computer programming, video editing, and website design. His greatest technological contribution was creating a digital exhibition on Eucharistic miracles around the world, which he began when he was just 11 years old. This project compiled and documented hundreds of Eucharistic miracles into a website, making them easily accessible to people globally. Today, his work continues to travel internationally as both a physical and online exhibition, allowing millions to learn about these miracles through modern technology.</p>
  <p>Carlo demonstrated that technology, when used responsibly, can be a powerful tool for good. Instead of using the internet for distraction or negative purposes, he used it as a means to spread truth, faith, and inspiration. His example shows that technology and holiness can coexist, inspiring young people to use their digital skills for innovation, education, and service to others. In this way, Carlo’s contribution lies not only in his technical creations but also in his witness—proving that technology can advance society when guided by values, purpose, and responsibility.</p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>In terms of education, Carlo Acutis showed how technology can be a tool for learning, teaching, and spreading knowledge. His digital project on Eucharistic miracles is a clear example of using technology for educational purposes, since it compiled historical, scientific, and faith-based information into a format that could be accessed by students, teachers, and ordinary people around the world. By creating an online exhibition at a young age, he demonstrated the power of digital resources in making information more engaging, interactive, and widely available.</p>
  <p>Carlo’s life also teaches students the importance of responsible and meaningful use of technology in education. Instead of being consumed by endless entertainment, he applied his skills to something with long-term value, showing how digital literacy can be paired with creativity and purpose. His example inspires learners to see technology not just as a tool for convenience, but as a pathway for deeper knowledge, sharing ideas, and contributing positively to society.</p>

  <p>Carlo often spoke of the Eucharist as his "highway to heaven," and he used his talents with technology to share the light of Christ with others. This game symbolizes catching the light of faith, just as Carlo invited people to embrace the light of God in their lives.</p>
  <p><em><strong>How to Play:</strong></em></p>
  <p>Move the basket left and right to catch the glowing lights before they fall. Each light you catch gives you points. Try to catch as many as you can!</p>

      <h3>Not Me But God Music Video</h3>
      <p>As Blessed Carlo Acutis once said, <i>“Non io, ma Dio”</i> — translated as “Not Me, but God.” This profound statement reflects his belief that all things are made possible not through self-esteem, but through the glory of God. Inspired by this spiritual faith, Mr. Michael S. Yanga, the President of Dr. Yanga’s Colleges, Inc. (DYCI) composed a song entitled <b>“Not Me, But God”</b> dedicated to St. Carlo Acutis. The song features the words <i>“Essere sempre unito a Gesù, ecco il mio programma di vita”</i> which means “To always be close to Jesus, that's my life plan” — another expression of Carlo’s deep devotion spoken during his lifetime. </p>
